This project demonstrates how to make API calls in Java using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, with LiveData, DataBinding, and a ViewModel with a Repository. MVVM helps in separating the UI from the data, making the app more modular, testable, and maintainable. LiveData is used for observing data changes in the ViewModel, ensuring that the UI is automatically updated. DataBinding enables a more declarative UI setup, linking UI components directly to data sources. This approach promotes a clean and efficient way to handle network operations and UI updates in Android applications.
